    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 16, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the "LocalHub" application (hereinafter referred to as "the App") developed by independent developer Baron Lee. We value your privacy, and this policy aims to explain how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Core Commitment: Local First</h2>
    <p>LocalHub is a tool for sharing files and media over a local network. <strong>Unless you actively choose to do so (e.g., sharing a link with others), your files, photos, videos, and other personal data are stored only on your local device and will never be uploaded to any cloud servers by us.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
    <p>To provide our services, we may process the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and Network Information:</strong> We need to access your device's IP address and network status to establish an HTTP server within the local network for other devices to access. This information is used locally only.</li>
        <li><strong>App Crash and Performance Logs:</strong> We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> and <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous crash reports and usage statistics (such as feature usage frequency) to help us fix bugs and improve app stability. These data do not contain your personally identifiable information or file contents.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> If you purchase premium services, transactions are processed by <strong>Google Play</strong>. We only receive transaction receipts (e.g., order numbers, subscription status) and do not have access to sensitive payment information such as your bank card numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions Usage</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions only when necessary for core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required for the "Camera Stream" feature, allowing you to stream your device's camera feed to other devices on your local network in real-time. We do not record or save your camera data.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Required for the "Camera Stream" feature if you choose to stream audio along with video.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage (Photos/Media/Files):</strong> Required to allow you to select files to share and to save files received from other devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to show the server running status and upload progress in the notification bar, ensuring the service keeps running in the background.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service & Screen Recording:</strong> Used for screen casting feature to capture screen content and stream it to connected devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Location / Nearby Devices:</strong> Required only to configure the local hotspot or manage Wi-Fi connections (depending on Android version). We do not collect or track your geographical location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates the following third-party services, which may have their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for crash analysis and data statistics. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">View Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for app distribution and billing settlement. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">View Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect your data. Local network transmission supports access token verification mechanisms to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing your files.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not designed for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions will be published within the App. Continued use of the App indicates your agreement to be bound by the revised policy.</p>
